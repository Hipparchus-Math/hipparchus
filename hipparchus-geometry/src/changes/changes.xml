This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.
-->

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="2.1" date="2022-04-24" description="This is a maintenance release. The main
      change is addition of equalsIee754 to points in all topologies to handle NaN coordinates.">
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" issue="issues/187">
        Fixed wrong set operation with ArcsSet when two BSP trees share
        the same angle as a cut hyperplane.

      <action dev="luc" type="add">
        Added equalsIee754 to S1Point, S2Point, Vector1D, Vector2D and Vector3D
        to have an equality method consistent with IEEE754 concerning NaN coordinates,
        in addition to the regular equals method compliant with Java language design
        choices, including Double.equals (which is different from the double == operator).

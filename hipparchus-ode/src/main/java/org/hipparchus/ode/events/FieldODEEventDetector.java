/** This interface represents a handler for discrete events triggered
 * during ODE integration.
 *
 * <p>Some events can be triggered at discrete times as an ODE problem
 * is solved. This occurs for example when the integration process
 * should be stopped as some state is reached (G-stop facility) when the
 * precise date is unknown a priori, or when the derivatives have
 * states boundaries crossings.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>These events are defined as occurring when a <code>g</code>
 * switching function sign changes.</p>
 *
 * <p>Since events are only problem-dependent and are triggered by the
 * independent <i>time</i> variable and the state vector, they can
 * occur at virtually any time, unknown in advance. The integrators will
 * take care to avoid sign changes inside the steps, they will reduce
 * the step size when such an event is detected in order to put this
 * event exactly at the end of the current step. This guarantees that
 * step interpolation (which always has a one step scope) is relevant
 * even in presence of discontinuities. This is independent from the
 * stepsize control provided by integrators that monitor the local
 * error (this event handling feature is available for all integrators,
 * including fixed step ones).</p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note that prior to Hipparchus 3.0, the methods in this interface were
 * in the {@link FieldODEEventHandler} interface and the defunct
 * {@code FieldEventHandlerConfiguration} interface. The interfaces have been
 * reorganized to allow different objects to be used in event detection
 * and event handling, hence allowing users to reuse predefined events
 * detectors with custom handlers.
 * </p>

     * <p>The discrete events are generated when the sign of this
     * switching function changes. The integrator will take care to change
     * the stepsize in such a way these events occur exactly at step boundaries.
     * The switching function must be continuous in its roots neighborhood
     * (but not necessarily smooth), as the integrator will need to find its
     * roots to locate precisely the events.</p>
     * <p>Also note that the integrator expect that once an event has occurred,
     * the sign of the switching function at the start of the next step (i.e.
     * just after the event) is the opposite of the sign just before the event.
     * This consistency between the steps <string>must</strong> be preserved,
     * otherwise {@link org.hipparchus.exception.MathIllegalArgumentException
     * exceptions} related to root not being bracketed will occur.</p>
     * <p>This need for consistency is sometimes tricky to achieve. A typical
     * example is using an event to model a ball bouncing on the floor. The first
     * idea to represent this would be to have {@code g(state) = h(state)} where h is the
     * height above the floor at time {@code state.getTime()}. When {@code g(state)} reaches 0, the
     * ball is on the floor, so it should bounce and the typical way to do this is
     * to reverse its vertical velocity. However, this would mean that before the
     * event {@code g(state)} was decreasing from positive values to 0, and after the
     * event {@code g(state)} would be increasing from 0 to positive values again.
     * Consistency is broken here! The solution here is to have {@code g(state) = sign
     * * h(state)}, where sign is a variable with initial value set to {@code +1}. Each
     * time {@link #eventOccurred(FieldODEStateAndDerivative, boolean) eventOccurred}
     * method is called, {@code sign} is reset to {@code -sign}. This allows the
     * {@code g(state)} function to remain continuous (and even smooth) even across events,
     * despite {@code h(state)} is not. Basically, the event is used to <em>fold</em>
     * {@code h(state)} at bounce points, and {@code sign} is used to <em>unfold</em> it
     * back, so the solvers sees a {@code g(state)} function which behaves smoothly even
     * across events.</p>
     *
     * <p>This method is idempotent, that is calling this multiple times with the same
     * state will result in the same value, with two exceptions. First, the definition of
     * the g function may change when an {@link #eventOccurred(FieldODEStateAndDerivative,
     * boolean) event occurs} on this handler, as in the above example. Second, the
     * definition of the g function may change when the {@link
     * #eventOccurred(FieldODEStateAndDerivative, boolean) eventOccurred} method of any
     * other event handler in the same integrator returns {@link Action#RESET_EVENTS},
     * {@link Action#RESET_DERIVATIVES}, or {@link Action#RESET_STATE}.
     *
     * @param state current value of the independent <i>time</i> variable, state vector
     * and derivative
     * @return value of the g switching function

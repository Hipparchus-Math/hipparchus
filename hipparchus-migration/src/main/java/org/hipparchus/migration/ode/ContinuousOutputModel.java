/**
 * This class stores all information provided by an ODE integrator
 * during the integration process and build a continuous model of the
 * solution from this.
 *
 * <p>This class act as a step handler from the integrator point of
 * view. It is called iteratively during the integration process and
 * stores a copy of all steps information in a sorted collection for
 * later use. Once the integration process is over, the user can use
 * the {@link #setInterpolatedTime setInterpolatedTime} and {@link
 * #getInterpolatedState getInterpolatedState} to retrieve this
 * information at any time. It is important to wait for the
 * integration to be over before attempting to call {@link
 * #setInterpolatedTime setInterpolatedTime} because some internal
 * variables are set only once the last step has been handled.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is useful for example if the main loop of the user
 * application should remain independent from the integration process
 * or if one needs to mimic the behaviour of an analytical model
 * despite a numerical model is used (i.e. one needs the ability to
 * get the model value at any time or to navigate through the
 * data).</p>
 *
 * <p>If problem modeling is done with several separate
 * integration phases for contiguous intervals, the same
 * ContinuousOutputModel can be used as step handler for all
 * integration phases as long as they are performed in order and in
 * the same direction. As an example, one can extrapolate the
 * trajectory of a satellite with one model (i.e. one set of
 * differential equations) up to the beginning of a maneuver, use
 * another more complex model including thrusters modeling and
 * accurate attitude control during the maneuver, and revert to the
 * first model after the end of the maneuver. If the same continuous
 * output model handles the steps of all integration phases, the user
 * do not need to bother when the maneuver begins or ends, he has all
 * the data available in a transparent manner.</p>
 *
 * <p>An important feature of this class is that it implements the
 * <code>Serializable</code> interface. This means that the result of
 * an integration can be serialized and reused later (if stored into a
 * persistent medium like a filesystem or a database) or elsewhere (if
 * sent to another application). Only the result of the integration is
 * stored, there is no reference to the integrated problem by
 * itself.</p>
 *
 * <p>One should be aware that the amount of data stored in a
 * ContinuousOutputModel instance can be important if the state vector
 * is large, if the integration interval is long or if the steps are
 * small (which can result from small tolerance settings in {@link
 * org.hipparchus.ode.nonstiff.AdaptiveStepsizeIntegrator adaptive
 * step size integrators}).</p>
 *

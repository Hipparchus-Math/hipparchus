# Transform methods
This package provides a few transformers for signal analysis. All transformers
provide both direct and inverse transforms.

  * [FastFourierTransformer](../apidocs/org/hipparchus/transform/FastFourierTransformer.html) (produces `Complex` results)
  * [FastCosineTransformer](../apidocs/org/hipparchus/transform/FastCosineTransformer.html) (produces real results)
  * [FastSineTransformer](../apidocs/org/hipparchus/transform/FastSineTransformer.html) (produces real results)
  * [FastHadamardTransformer](../apidocs/org/hipparchus/transform/FastHadamardTransformer.html) (produces real results)

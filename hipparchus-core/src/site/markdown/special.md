functions not provided by `java.lang.Math`.

### Regularized Beta

(see [MathWorld](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RegularizedBetaFunction.html))

### Elliptic functions and integrals

Notations in the domain of elliptic functions and integrals is often confusing and inconsistent
across text books. Hipparchus implementation uses the `parameter m` to define both Jacobi elliptic
functions and Legendre elliptic integrals and uses the `nome q` to define Jacobi theta functions.
The elliptic modulus `k` (which is the square of parameter m) is not used at all in Hipparchus. All these
parameters are linked together.

See in MathWorld [elliptic integrals of the first kind](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegraloftheFirstKind.html),
[elliptic integrals of the second kind](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegraloftheSecondKind.html),
[elliptic integrals of the third kind](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/EllipticIntegraloftheThirdKind.html),
[Jacobi elliptic functions](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/JacobiEllipticFunctions.html) and
[Jacobi theta functions](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/JacobiThetaFunctions.html).

`JacobiEllipticBuilder.build(m)` builds a `JacobiElliptic` (or `FieldJacobiElliptic`) implementation for the parameter
`m` that computes the twelve elliptic functions \\(sn(u|m)\\), \\(cn(u|m)\\), \\(dn(u|m)\\),
\\(cs(u|m)\\), \\(ds(u|m)\\), \\(ns(u|m)\\), \\(dc(u|m)\\), \\(nc(u|m)\\), \\(sc(u|m)\\), \\(nd(u|m)\\),
\\(sd(u|m)\\), and \\(cd(u|m)\\). The functions are computed as copolar triplets as when one function is needed
in an expression, the two other are often also needed. The inverse functions \\(arcsn(u|m)\\), \\(arccn(u|m)\\), \\(arcdn(u|m)\\),
\\(arccs(u|m)\\), \\(arcds(u|m)\\), \\(arcns(u|m)\\), \\(arcdc(u|m)\\), \\(arcnc(u|m)\\), \\(arcsc(u|m)\\), \\(arcnd(u|m)\\),
\\(arcsd(u|m)\\), and \\(arccd(u|m)\\) are also available.

`JacobiTheta` (and `FieldJacobiTheta`) computes the four Jacobi theta functions \\(\theta_1(z|\\tau)\\), \\(\theta_2(z|\\tau)\\),
\\(\theta_3(z|\\tau)\\), and \\(\theta_4(z|\\tau)\\). The half-period ratio \\(\\tau\\) is linked to the nome `q`:
\\(q = e^{i\\pi\\tau}\\). Here again, the four functions are computed at once and a quadruplet is returned.

`CarlsonEllipticIntegrals` is a utility class that computes the following integrals in Carlson symmetric form,
for both primitive double, `CalculusFieldElement`, `Complex` and `FieldComplex`:

| Name               |  Definition                                                                                                                  |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| \\(R_F(x,y,z)\\)   | \\(\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{s(t)}\\)                                                              |
| \\(R_J(x,y,z,p)\\) | \\(\\frac{3}{2}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{\\mathrm{d}t}{s(t)(t+p)}\\)                                                         |
| \\(R_G(x,y,z)\\)   | \\(\frac{1}{4}\\int_{0}^{\\infty}\\frac{1}{s(t)}\\left(\\frac{x}{t+x}+\\frac{y}{t+y}+\\frac{z}{t+z}\\right)t\\mathrm{d}t \\) |
| \\(R_D(x,y,z)\\)   | \\(R_J(x,y,z,z)\\)                                                                                                           |
| \\(R_C(x,y)\\)     | \\(R_F(x,y,y)\\)                                                                                                             |

where \\(s(t) = \\sqrt{t+x}\\sqrt{t+y}\\sqrt{t+z}\\).

`LegendreEllipticIntegrals` is a utility class that computes the following integrals,
for both primitive double, `CalculusFieldElement`, `Complex` and `FieldComplex`.
(the implementation uses `CarlsonEllipticIntegrals` internally):

| Name                  | Type       |  Definition                                                                                      |

| \\(D(m) \\)           |  complete  | \\(\\frac{K(m) - E(m)}{m}\\)                                                                     |
| \\(\Pi(n, m)\\)       |  complete  | \\(\\int_0^{\\frac{\\pi}{2}} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1-m \\sin^2\\theta}(1-n \\sin^2\\theta)}\\) |
| \\(F(\phi, m)\\)      | incomplete | \\(\\int_0^{\\phi} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1-m \\sin^2\\theta}}\\)                               |
| \\(E(\phi, m)\\)      | incomplete | \\(\\int_0^{\\phi} \\sqrt{1-m \\sin^2\\theta} d\\theta\\)                                        |
| \\(D(\phi, m)\\)      | incomplete | \\(\\frac{K(\\phi, m) - E(\\phi, m)}{m}\\)                                                       |
| \\(\Pi(n, \phi, m)\\) | incomplete | \\(\\int_0^{\\phi} \\frac{d\\theta}{\\sqrt{1-m \\sin^2\\theta}(1-n \\sin^2\\theta)}\\)           |

Beware that when computing elliptic integrals in the complex plane,
many issues arise due to branch cuts. One typical example is the
integral \\(\Pi(n, \phi, m)\\), which is defined as
\\[
\int_0^{\varphi} \frac{d\theta}{\sqrt{1-m \sin^2\theta}(1-n \sin^2\theta)}
\|`
\\(\phi\\) is the amplitude, \\(n\\) is the elliptic characteristic,
\\(m\\) is the ellipse parameter (some conventions use the elliptic
modulus \\(k\\) such that \\(m=k^2\\) instead of the parameter
\\(m\\), or they use the nome \\(\\)). All variables that appear in
this expression may be complex.

The integrand has poles corresponding to
\\[
\theta_m = \pm \arcsin\frac{1}{\sqrt{m}},\quad\theta_n = \pm \arcsin\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}
\]`
and their periodic repetitions due to the inverse sines.

The integral is expected to be computed over the straight path from
\\(0\\) to \\(\phi\\). With this assumption, the integral is a
single-valued function. The following picture shows the value of the
integral for n=3.4-1.3i and m=0.2+0.6i.

![numerical integration](images/userguide/integral-of-the-third-kind-numerical.png)

One can clearly see the pole near 0.537+0.110i as the start point of a
ray separating a green and a purple zone. Domain coloring uses hue to
represent phase plus periodic brightness to enhance both modulus and
phase. The sharp green/purple transition on the right hand side shows
there is a discontinuity when crossing this ray. There is another pole
(less visible) near 0.785-0.909i and another ray. Drawing the integral
on a larger range would show other rays dues to the repetitions of
these poles.

If we take care to never cross the rays cast by poles, we could in
fact compute the integral using other paths than the straight line
from \\(0\\) to \\(\phi\\). We could for example start parallel to the
real axis and then parallel to the imaginary axis, or any other path.

If on the other hand we compute the integral using a path that crosses
these rays (i.e. a path that goes after the poles and then bends
upwards or downward before reaching \\(\phi\\), then we don't notice
that we cross the rays because in fact there are no poles along the
path, the poles are really isolated. So in this case, we compute a
value of the integral that is finite and looks perfectly reasonable,
but is different from the value that would be computed by the straight
path. The following example shows one example of the results we could
obtain.

![Carlson evaluation](images/userguide/integral-of-the-third-kind-Carlson.png)

We see that the purple region extended upwards in a wave-like
shape. In fact, we have chosen a different sheet of the Riemann
surface that represent the integral value.

The first image was really computed using numerical integration. The
second image was in fact computed using the Carlson transformation
that allows much faster results.

Numerical integration is not only very slow, it sometimes fails to
converge. The tiny white points on the ray cast by the first pole
correspond to failures: the integrator exceeded its maximum number of
iterations (despite it was huge). The lower ray is also in fact
probably false numerically, there should be a more pronounced color
change, here we seem to just have some darker purple which I think is
wrong.

Carlson transformations are extremely fast, but they obviously select
the wrong value without notice. The changes occur when during internal
iterations we compute a value
\\(\lambda_m=\sqrt{x_m}\sqrt{y_m}+\sqrt{x_m}\sqrt{z_m}+\sqrt{y_m}\sqrt{z_m}\\).
According to Carlson, each root must be computed separately and in
each case the root with nonnegative real part must be selected (this
is important because \\(\sqrt{x_m}\sqrt{y_m}\\) and \\(\sqrt{x_m
y_m}\\) may lead to different roots selection in the complex
plane). If during computation one the value crosses the real axis
while being negative, then the root selection switches from one root
to its conjugate: the imaginary part changes its sign instantly. After
the switch, the iterative algorithm continues flawlessly and
converges. It may even converge to the same median point that it had
before the switch, but as the intermediate values are used in the
computation of \\(\Pi(n, \phi, m)\\) (they are not used in the
computations of the integrals of the first kind \\(F(\phi, m)\\) and
of the second kind \\(E(\phi, m)\\)), the final value computed for the
integral is not the correct one. The algorithm has switched from one
sheet of the Riemann surface to another one, and we have no way to
know it. It is even weird as when we are in the vicinity of the ray,
the truth would be to see a discontinuity, but the result we get is
that the algorithm somehow recreates a continuous surface, which when
looking only at a few values and the evolution in the neighborhood
seems correct.

Hipparchus results have been checked against Wolfram Alpha as it is a
reference we trust. Unfortunately, we cannot draw the same picture
using a free account at Wolfram cloud because this computation exceeds
the allowed time. So we just used the forms on Wolfram Alpha site and
got values one by one... Our check was to compute the integrals with
the end point \\(\phi\\) moving from 1.2-1.5i to 1.2+0.75i. This means
that despite the initial point of my integral was always 0+0i, the end
point of the integral was moving along a line parallel to the
imaginary axis. So the first integrals were computed using a path
slanted downwards that was below the poles and ended up in the purple
region, whereas the last integrals were computed using a slanted path
that was above the pole and ended up in the green region. Of course,
there were some specific value of \\(\phi\\) that came very close to
the pole and ended up on the singularity. The various columns of the
table are:

  1) integral end point
  2) numerical integration using a straight path from \\(0\\) to \\(\phi\\)
  3) numerical integration using a path with an intermediate point at pole+i (i.e. above the pole)
  4) numerical integration using a path with an intermediate point at pole-i (i.e. below first pole, and then above second pole)
  5) numerical integration using a path with two intermediate points below both poles
  6) computation using Carlson transforms
  7) reference values from Wolfram Alpha

This table shows the discontinuities. We see that as \\(\phi\\) goes
from 1.2 -1.5i to 1.2+0.75i, all method have singularities. There are
ranges in which several agree, and ranges in which some switch to the
wrong sheet of the Riemann surface. Comparing column 2 (straight
integration) and column 6 (Carlson transforms), corresponds to looking in
the first two pictures at the vertical line with real value 1.2.  We
see that for \\(\phi=1.2+0.2467578160i\\), the straight integral failed to
compute, and we see that below and above this value, the integral
exhibits a discontinuity. This is correct and this is the result we
want. For the low values of \\(\phi\\) however, the values of the numerical
integral seem strange to us, we think it failed to converge.

For low values, Carlson based computation is on fact quite good, but
it fails after some time, and when it switches, it switches to some
wrong sheet that corresponds to none of the three integration paths we
used.

Surprisingly, Wolfram Alpha seems to be quite wrong in a number of
places. Around \\(\phi=1.2+0.0852i\\), it even switches twice in a very
short interval, and then switch to the same value of the above
integral. This means in Wolfram Alpha, the green area that should be
above the ray extends much below.

A suggestion to fall back to numerical integration when Carlson fails
has been attempted but the problem is that there is no sign when
Carlson fails. It computes something, and what it computes is
realistic. Carlson gives one sufficient (but not necessary) condition
for success, with one of the intermediate variables that should have a
positive real part. This condition however corresponds to a very small
zone (roughly the red-yellow bubble near origin) and numerical
integration sometimes fails dramatically (with an exception triggered
by maximum iteration reached).

So as a conclusion, care must be taken when computing elliptical
integrals in the complex plane. The same kind of problems is already
noted in other implementation, as one can see from [this
warning](https://flintlib.org/doc/acb_elliptic.html?highlight=elliptic)
in the Flint library.

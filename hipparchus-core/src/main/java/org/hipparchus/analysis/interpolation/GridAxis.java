/**
 * Helper for finding interpolation nodes along one axis of grid data.
 * <p>
 * This class is intended to be used for interpolating inside grids.
 * It works on any sorted data without duplication and size at least
 * {@code n} where {@code n} is the number of points required for
 * interpolation (i.e. 2 for linear interpolation, 3 for quadratic...)
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The method uses linear interpolation to select the nodes indices.
 * It should be O(1) for sufficiently regular data, therefore much faster
 * than bisection. It also features caching, which improves speed when
 * interpolating several points in raw in the close locations, i.e. when
 * successive calls have a high probability to return the same interpolation
 * nodes. This occurs for example when scanning with small steps a loose
 * grid. The method also works on non-regular grids, but may be slower in
 * this case.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This class is thread-safe.
 * </p>
 * @since 1.4

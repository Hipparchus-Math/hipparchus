This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.
-->

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="1.5" date="2019-05-06" description="This is a maintenance release, it
    includes only bug fixes.">
      <action dev="luc" type="fix" due-to="Hao Peng">
        Nullify corrected state after predict in abstract Kalman filter. Note that this affects
        only custom extensions of AbstractKalmanFilter because the implementations provided
        by Hipparchus (LinearKalmanFilter and ExtendedKalmanFilter) always call correction
        step after having called prediction step, so the nullified corrected state is reset
        properly at the end. This was initially reported as https://gitlab.orekit.org/orekit/orekit/issues/540.

    <release version="1.4" date="2018-11-17" description="This is a maintenance release. The main

This file is used by the maven-changes-plugin to generate the release notes.
Useful ways of finding items to add to this file are:

1.  Add items when you fix a bug or add a feature (this makes the
release process easy :-).

2.  Do a JIRA search for tickets closed since the previous release.

3.  Use the report generated by the maven-changelog-plugin to see all
SVN commits.

To generate the file RELEASE-NOTES.txt from this file:

mvn changes:announcement-generate -Prelease-notes [-Dchanges.version]

The <action> type attribute can be add,update,fix,remove.

<!-- NOTE:
The description attribute entries below are specially formatted 
so as to improve the layout of the generated text release notes.

The parsing process removes all line feeds, replacing them with a single space.
The Velocity template in src/changes/release-notes.vm has been enhanced to replace pairs of adjacent spaces
with a new-line in the release notes. (These spaces are ignored when displaying HTML).
If the output is not quite correct, check for invisible trailing spaces!

    <release version="1.3" date="2018-05-08" description="This is a maintenance release.
    Changes in this module only consist in bug fixes in MannWhitneyTest and WilcoxonSignedRankTest.">
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="issues/38">
        Corrected MannWhitneyTest to report the U statistic used in the test and improved
        accuracy of the reported p-values by 1) adding an implementation
        of exact computation for small sample sizes 2) applying continuity correction
        to the normal approximation when this is used 3) adjusting variance for the presence
        of ties in the data. The problem with the U statistic was reported against Apache
        Commons Math as MATH-1453.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="issues/37">
        Corrected WilcoxonSignedRankTest to discard tied pairs and to correctly perform
        continuity correction when estimating p-values using the normal approximation.
        This was reported against Apache Commons Math as MATH-1233.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.2" date="2017-10-25" description="This is a maintenance release.">
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="issues/25">
        Fixed an error in EmpiricalDistribution causing cumulative probabilities to be returned
        as NaN when some data bins are empty.  This was reported against Apache Commons Math as
        MATH-1431.
      </action>
    </release>
    <release version="1.1" date="2017-03-16" description="This is a maintenance release.">
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix" issue="issues/13" >
        Fixed overly-aggressive sufficient data check in OLS/GLS regression classes.
        When there is no intercept in the model, the number of observations can equal
        the number of regressors.  GitHub: fixes #13.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="fix">
        Fixed bug in 2-sided binomial test leading to inflated p-values in some
        cases.  This was reported against Commons Math as MATH-1381.
      </action>
      <action dev="psteitz" type="add">
        Add implementation of RANDOM algorithm for streaming percentile computation.

      <action dev="tn" type="add">
        "StorelessUnivariateStatistic", "DescriptiveStatistics" and "StreamingStatistics"

      <action dev="tn" type="add">
        Added "AggregatableStatistic" interface for statistics that can
        aggregate results.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Added aggregation capabilities to "StreamingStatistics", replacing
        the removed class "AggregatingSummaryStatistics".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="remove">
        Removed "SynchronizedSummaryStatistics", "SynchronizedDescriptiveStatistics"
        and "SynchronizedMultivariateSummaryStatistics". All implementations
        are considered to be not threadsafe. Aggregation of results is preferred
        over synchronization.
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Renamed "SummaryStatistics" to "StreamingStatistics".
        Additionally, removed support for setting custom statistics

        Removed static "copy(A, B)" methods for storeless statistics.

        "Median" does not extend from "Percentile" anymore, but uses composition instead.

        Summary statistics based on external moments (e.g. Mean, Variance)
        are now immutable.

      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        Simplified "BinomialConfidenceInterval" and its implementations
        into class "BinomialProportion".
      </action>
      <action dev="tn" type="update">
        "Frequency" class now uses generics. For similar functionality as previous
        class wrt integer numbers, use "LongFrequency" which supports adding
        different integer number types (e.g. int, long, short) to the same
        "LongFrequency" instance. 
      </action>
      <action dev="luc" type="update">
        Simplified exception hierarchy.

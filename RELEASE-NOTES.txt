              Hipparchus 3.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-3.0

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a major release.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/221:  Added Principal Component Analysis. Thanks to Paul King. 
o issues/270:  Max check interval in events detectors can now depend on current state. 
o              Added torque-free motion model for non-symmetrical rigid body in ODE tests,
               with analytical theoretical reference solution. Thanks to Lucas Girodet.
o issues/212:  Added Blendable interface and its implementation in RealMatrix and Vector interfaces.
               Changed Vector interface parameters.
               Added SmoothStepFactory which allow for quick creation of common and generic smoothstep function.
o issues/218:  Fieldified Erf and Gamma classes and added FieldContinuedFraction. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/238:  Fixed internal error in RandomPercentile aggregation. 
o issues/230:  Fixed wrong intermediate frame in torque-free motion model. 
o issues/275:  UnivariateDerivative now implements Comparable. 
o issues/274:  Complex now implements Comparable, using real part as primary sort order
               and imaginary part as secondary sort order (similar to what ComplexComparator
               already did).
o issues/253:  Fixed eigenvalues/eigenvectors sorting in EigenDecompositionSymmetric. 
o issues/273:  Added a protection against out of range BigFraction. 
o issues/272:  Fixed compatibility with recent JDK. 
o issues/257:  Made FieldPolynomialSplineFunction operational with Field not inheriting from Comparable. Thanks to Romain Serra. 
o issues/262:  Fixed determinant computation in eigen decomposition with complex eigenvalues. 
o issues/259:  Only remove input coefficients of FieldPolynomialFunction that satisfy isZero(). Thanks to Romain Serra. 
o issues/249:  Generate zero vectors in OrderedComplexEigenDecomposition when the number
               of eigenvectors is smaller than the dimension.
o issues/248:  Allow customization of eigen value ordering in OrderedComplexEigenDecomposition. 
o issues/228:  Fixed FastMath.expm1(x) for huge values of x. 

Changes:
o issues/271:  Removed unused mapper in initializeStep. Thanks to Romain Serra. 
o issues/223:  Separated {Field}ODEEventDetector and {Field}ODEEventHandler. 
o issues/220:  Added reset state and stop integration capability at end of step for ODE integrators. 
o issues/243:  Improve management of Cardan/Euler rotations close to singularity. 
o              Replaced EigenDecomposition by EigenDecompositionSymmetric and EigenDecompositionNonSymmetric.
o              Removed OrderedEigenDecomposition.
o issues/256:  Improved performance for reciprocal, division and square root with
               DerivativeStructure and FieldDerivativeStructure. Thanks to Romain Serra.
o issues/227:  Renamed Decimal64{Field} into Binary64{Field}. 
o issues/223:  Separated {Field}ODEEventDetector and {Field}ODEEventHandler.

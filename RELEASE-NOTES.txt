              Hipparchus 2.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-2.0

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a major release. The main changes is the addition of a sequential Gauss-Newton optimizer,
improved relative scheduling of step handlers and events handlers in ODE,
addition of a finish callback in step handlers, replacement of RealFieldElement by CalculusFieldElement interface,
many improvements in Complex to fully implement CalculusFieldElement with correct branch cuts so complex numbers
can be used in many Hipparchus algorithms, addition of FieldComplex, implementation of elliptic functions and
integrals (for real, complex and general fields), and faster simultaneous computation of sinhcos.
Methods deprecated during the 1.X series have been removed. Numerous bugs were also fixed.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/147: Allow retrieving event handler configuration from ODE integrators. 
o issues/146: Added a separate finish method in ODE step handlers to be called after last step. 
o issues/143: Added ArrayFieldVector.toString(). 
o             Added sequential Gauss-Newton optimizer. Thanks to Julie Bayard. 
o issues/135: Added getRowDimension and getColumnDimension to DecompositionSolver and FieldDecompositionSolver. 
o issues/141: Added a way to have a more accurate value of π for fields implementations that require it. 
o             Added Carlson elliptic integrals (R_F, R_J, R_G, R_D, and R_C)
              both for real, CalculusFieldElement, Complex, and FieldComplex. 
o issues/124: Changed return types for field elements methods (including Complex):
              norm() → double, abs() → field element. 
o             Added the four Jacobi theta functions θ₁(z|τ), θ₂(z|τ), θ₃(z|τ), and θ₄(z|τ),
              both for complex and field complex. 
o issues/126: Added field-based complex numbers. 
o             Added Legendre elliptic integrals (K, K', E, D, F, Π), both complete and incomplete,
              both for real, CalculusFieldElement, Complex, and FieldComplex. 
o issues/119: Added the twelve Jacobi elliptic functions sn, cn, dn,
              cs, ds, ns, dc, nc, sc, nd, sd, and cd, both for primitive double
              and fields. 
o             Added the Ryū algorithm to generate very fast the shortest decimal
              representation of a floating point number that maintains round-trip safety. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/145: Fixed out-of-order scheduling of calls to step handlers and event handlers. 
o issues/144: Fixed array index error in field LU decomposition. Thanks to Axel Kramer. 
o issues/142: Fixed ulp() implementation for Dfp. 
o issues/140: Clarified arguments in the one-argument version of the two-arguments atan2
              function in CalculusFieldElement. 
o issues/138: Renamed signum into sign in field classes, and improved implementation for complex numbers. 
o issues/131: Fixed consistent implementations between {Field}LUDecomposition classes. 
o issues/129: Fixed branch cut on imaginary axis for complex atan. 
o issues/123: Added field implementations of ulp function. 
o issues/122: Added a way to compute both sinh and cosh at once faster than performing two calls.
              This also speeds up all derivatives implementations as well as complex computations. 
o issues/121: Removed methods and constants deprecated during the 1.x series. 
o issues/67:  Replaced RealFieldElement by CalculusFieldElement interface and have Complex
              implement it so it can be used in many Hipparchus algorithms (like ODE).
              Also replaced RealField{Univariate|Bivariate|Vector|Matrix}Function by
              CalculusField{Univariate|Bivariate|Vector|Matrix}Function. 
o issues/120: Added event filtering for field ODE. 
o issues/118: Use primitive double for initial step and error factors in Field adaptive step size integrators. 
o issues/112: Fix interpolation of a pair of ODE states whose times are the same. Such a pair can
              appear when a RESET_STATE or RESET_DERIVATIVES event occurs at the integration
              stop time. Thanks to andrewsgoetz. 
o issues/111: Allow selecting customized threshold for tests in OrderedComplexEigenDecomposition. 
o issues/110: Added zero checker predicate for some linear algebra algorithms. 
o issues/109: Fixed exception in OrderedComplexEigenDecomposition when eigenvalues are equal.

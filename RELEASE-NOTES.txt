              Hipparchus 2.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-2.1
The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.
This is a maintenande release. The main changes are:

  - addition of 3D version of complex function plotter,
  - addition of ConvergenceCheckerOrMultiplexer and ConvergenceCheckerAndMultiplexer,
  - addition of inverse Jacobi elliptic functions,
  - optional modified weights to Akima interpolation,
  - modified Gram-Schmidt basis orthonormalization process,
  - generation of convergents streams in continued fractions,
  - addition of equalsIee754 to points in all topologies to handle NaN coordinates.

 Various bugs were fixed.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issue/172:  Added optional modified weights to avoid overshoots in Akima interpolation
        near constant slopes sub-samples. 
o issue/136:  Added ConvergenceCheckerOrMultiplexer and ConvergenceCheckerAndMultiplexer. 
o           Added equalsIee754 to S1Point, S2Point, Vector1D, Vector2D and Vector3D
        to have an equality method consistent with IEEE754 concerning NaN coordinates,
        in addition to the regular equals method compliant with Java language design
        choices, including Double.equals (which is different from the double == operator). 
o issue/176:  Allow generation of continued fractions convergents as streams of BigFraction/Fraction
        to allow user to apply their own convergence criterion to select one convergent. 
o issue/173:  Fixed inconsistency of eigenvalues and eigenvectors between OrderedComplexEigenDecomposition
        and base class ComplexEigenDecomposition. 

Fixed Bugs:
o issue/189:  Fixed some wrong branch cuts in inverse Jacobi elliptic functions in the complex case. 
o issue/186:  Avoid building an intermediate complex for computing double norm. 
o issue/175:  Fixed overflows for incrementors that are allowed to reach Integer.MAX_VALUE. 
o issue/188:  Added inverse Jacobi elliptic functions, for both double and field values. 
o issues/187:  Fixed wrong set operation with ArcsSet when two BSP trees share
        the same angle as a cut hyperplane. 
o issues/184:  Fixed non-bracketing issue when RESET_STATE slightly moves an event at the start
        of a step and another regular event happens in the first half of the same step 
o issue/183:  Avoid too many calls to function in BracketingNthOrderBrentSolver when using
        AllowedSolution.ANY_SIDE. 
o issue/178:  Added Modified Gram-Schmidt basis orthonormalization process in MatrixUtils
        for double-based and CalculusFieldElement-based list of vectors. 
o issue/177:  Fixed issue in Laguerre solver related to different representations of signed zeros. 

Changes:
o           Added a 3D version of complex plots.

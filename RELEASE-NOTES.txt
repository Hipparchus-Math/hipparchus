              Hipparchus 3.1 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus-3.1

The Hipparchus library is a library of mathematical components. It started as a fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is a maintenance release. It includes several bugfixes and
improvements, and adds one important feature: constrained
optimization! Other additions are Gauss-Markov order 1 autoregressive
process generation and GCD/LCM to {Big}Fraction.

Changes in this version include:

New features:
o issues/269:  Add public, static access to integrators name.
o issues/300:  Add possibility to use real coefficients for Butcher array based Field integrators.
o issues/296:  Added constrained optimization. Thanks to Francesco Rocca.
o issues/294:  Added GCD and LCM to {Big}Fraction. Thanks to Axel Kramer.
o issues/281:  Add default implementations in CalculusFieldElement and inheritors.
o issues/280:  Add square method to CalculusFieldElement.

Fixed Bugs:
o issues/290:  Fixes regressions with Field in event detection.
o issues/291:  Fix broken newInstance method for FieldTuple.

Changes:
o issues/277:  Improved release guide. Thanks to Bryan.
o issues/333:  Added Gauss-Markov order 1 autoregressive process generation.
o issues/289:  Added equals and hashCode to OpenIntTo{Double|Field}HashMap.
o issues/327:  Allow variable arguments for building PolynomialFunction.
o issues/322:  Extracted class JacobiKey from PolynomialsUtils.
o issues/304:  Allow retrieving correct Cardan/Euler angles even at singularity.
o issues/302:  Improved performance of Gradient.
o issues/288:  Replace uses of scalar multiplication on Field one.
o issues/286:  Rework interfaces for Derivative and FieldDerivative.

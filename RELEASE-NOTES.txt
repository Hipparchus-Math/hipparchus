              Hipparchus 1.0 RELEASE NOTES

The Hipparchus team is pleased to announce the release of hipparchus 1.0.

The Hipparchus library is a self-contained library of mathematical components. It started as a
fork of Apache Commons Math.

This is the first release of the library.  Hipparchus is divided into modules.  This release includes all
modules.  Subsequently, modules may be released separately.

Following is a summary of the differences between Hipparchus and Apache Commons Math at the time of the fork
(February, 2016).

GLOBAL
======

o  The library has been modularized into several components
   (hipparchus-core, hipparchus-clustering, hipparchus-fft,
   hipparchus-fitting, hipparchus-genetics, hipparchus-geometry,
   hipparchus-geometry, hipparchus-ode, hipparchus-optim,
   hipparchus-samples, hipparchus-stat).  All other components depend on hipparchus-core,
   and hipparchus-clustering depends on hipparchus-stat. 
o  EmpiricalDistribution and MultivariateNormalExpectationMaximization have been moved from
o  The exceptions hierarchy has been simplified and many exception classes have been eliminated. 
o  Hipparchus includes a migration module and an associated script
   to help switching from Apache Commons Math to Hipparchus.

Core
====

New features:
o  Added Gauss-Laguerre quadrature for integration of improper integrals. 

Fixed Bugs:
o  Fixed "HypergeometricDistribution#logProbability(int)" which returned NaN
   in case the number of successes equals the population size. 
o  Fix DerivativeStructure.pow for 0 argument and power less than 1. Thanks to Andrea Antolino. 
o  Fix "FastMath#round(..)" to comply to changed contract of "Math#round()" in Java 8. 
o  Fixed DerivativeStructure.pow(0.0) which was NaN when the DS was 0, despite it should
   always be 1.0 in this case, regardless of the base (even if the base is NaN, in fact). 

Changes:
o  Renamed TestUtils in core stat.inference to InferenceTestUtils and TestUtils in
   the core unit test package to UnitTestUtils. 
o  Moved EmpiricalDistribution and MultivariateNormalExpectationMaximization from
   the random package into stat.fitting and dropped ValueServer. 
o  Moved sampling (random deviate generation) from distribution implementations 
   to RandomDataGenerator in the random package. 
o  Refactored distribution implementations into separate sub-packages:
   "discrete", "continuous" and "multivariate". 
o  Simplified "PivotingStrategyInterface" and implementations into single
   enum class "PivotingStrategy". 
o  "RealVector#Entry" is now public. 
o  "RealLinearOperator" is now an interface. 

Removed:
o  Removed interface "DoubleArray". 
o  Removed interface "NumberTransformer" and classes "TransformerMap" and
   "DefaultTransformer" related to transformation of arbitrary objects
   to double primitives. 
 o Removed accuracy parameter in constructors of "RealDistribution" implementations
   that calculate the inverse cumulative probability analytically. 
o  Removed "copyOf" and "copyOfRange" methods in "MathArrays". "Object#clone()"
   and "Arrays#copyOfRange(...)" should be used instead. 

ode
===

Fixed Bugs:
o Fixed wrong handling of state resets in Adams-Bashforth and Adams-Moulton integrators. 
o Fixed infinite loop when some step reduction was silently filtered to min step
  in Gragg-Bulirsch-Stoer integrator.
o Enhanced reliability of event detection with multiple event detectors. 

Changes:
o  Revamped Ordinary Differential Equations API to match
   the new API introduced with field-based ODE. 
o  Added early detection of NaNs appearing during integration. 

stat
====
New features:
o  Added "AggregatableStatistic" interface for statistics that can
   aggregate results. 


Changes:
o  Refactored descriptive statistics package to simplify API and implementations and use
   more meaningful class names. 
o  Added aggregation capabilities to "StreamingStatistics", replacing
   the removed class "AggregatingSummaryStatistics". 
o  Renamed "SummaryStatistics" to "StreamingStatistics". Additionally, removed support
  for setting custom statistics implementations. 
o  Replaced "VectorialMean" with a more generic class "VectorialStorelessStatistic"
   which supports applying any "StorelessUnivariateStatistic" on vector data. 
o  "Median" does not extend from "Percentile" anymore, but uses composition instead. 
o  Summary statistics based on external moments (e.g. Mean, Variance)
   are now immutable. 
o  Simplified "BinomialConfidenceInterval" and its implementations
   into class "BinomialProportion". 
o  "Frequency" class now uses generics. For similar functionality as previous
   class wrt integer numbers, use "LongFrequency" which supports adding
   different integer number types (e.g. int, long, short) to the same
   "LongFrequency" instance. 
 
Removed:
o  Removed "SynchronizedSummaryStatistics", "SynchronizedDescriptiveStatistics"
   and "SynchronizedMultivariateSummaryStatistics". All implementations
   are considered to be not threadsafe. Aggregation of results is preferred
   over synchronization. 
o  Removed static "copy(A, B)" methods for storeless statistics.

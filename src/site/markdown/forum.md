# Hipparchus Forum

Hipparchus uses a forum as a communication channel. There are three categories
in the forum:

  * [Hipparchus annoucements](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-announcements)
  * [Hipparchus usage](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-usage)
  * [Hipparchus development](https://forum.orekit.org/c/hipparchus-development)

Regular users should subscribe to the forum and configure
their preferences to add these categories to the "Watched" list so they are
notified when a new message appears there.

Questions related to the usage of Hipparchus should be posted to the
users forum category. The developers forum category
is for questions and discussion related to the development of Hipparchus.
Please do not cross-post; developers are also subscribed to the users channel.
The announcements forum category is read-only
and devoted to announce important news (like new releases).
